# Elementalist - Particle Rendering System

Elementalist is a particle rendering system optimized for efficiency and realism. It allows developers to create visually stunning particle effects in virtual worlds.

## Introduction

Modern games often rely on particle systems to simulate various effects, such as smoke, fire, water, and more. ELEMentalist addresses the challenge of efficiently rendering a large number of particles in real-time while maintaining visual accuracy.

## Features

- SIMD optimization for vector and matrix operations.
- Proxy pattern for matrix multiplication.
- Custom memory allocator using placement_new.
- Custom SSE rand() function for random number generation.
- Return Value Optimization (RVO).

## Requirements

- Development Environment: Visual Studio.
- Version Control System: Git.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ritwija05/multimedia_project.git
Open the GameParticles.sln solution file in Visual Studio.

Build and run the project.
